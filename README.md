# Google Play Store Data Analysis

## Please check the results folder for detailed results.

The aim of this project is to understand and evaluate which factors are more likely to have an effect on the number of users who installed/downloaded an application on Google Play Store. Thus, the research question of the project is: “Which features of Google Play Store apps are more likely to have positive or negative correlation with the number of downloads of a given app?”

The dataset that is being used in this project is “Google Play Store” dataset. It can be found on the main branch, please check if needed. This dataset consists of 10841 rows and 13 column variables: the name of the app, its category, the rating that it has received, number of reviews, its size, number of installs, the type, the price, the content of the rating, genre, last update date, current version and finally each app’s Android version.

These are some main questions this project tried to answer:
• Is rating important when someone downloads an app?
• Do users consider the size of an app when they are about to install?
• Does the content of an app is related to the number of downloads it receives?
• What should be the content of age when designing an app?
• Does making an app non-free have an effect on the download numbers?
• Does an app having higher number of reviews mean it is downloaded more frequently?

After the data analysis, Machine learning methods such as kNN, Decision Tree and Random Forest have been applied.
